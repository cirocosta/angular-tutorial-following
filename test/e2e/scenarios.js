/**
 * Different from the unit tests at ../unit, E2E tests are made for
 * testing DOM response to events and other stuff that are wired in our
 * application.
 * @see  http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing Another
 * great reference is:
 * https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md,
 * which i'll be using in a further release.
 *
 * Seeing the page of the karma-ng-scenario, it recomends to go with
 * Protractor for this e2e stuff. Seems like karma-ng-scenario is no
 * longer mantained.
 *
 * For running tests, Protractor, which is a wrapper around WebDriverJS,
 * needs to talk to a Selenium standalone server running as a separate
 * process.
